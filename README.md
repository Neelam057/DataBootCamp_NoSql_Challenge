# MongoDB Food Hygiene Database challenge

This challenge involves setting up a MongoDB database to store and query data related to food hygiene ratings from the UK Food Standards Agency. The data is provided in a JSON format, and the task is to import it into a MongoDB database and perform various queries and analysis using the `pymongo` library in Python.

## Project Requirements

- **MongoDB Database**: `uk_food`
- **MongoDB Collection**: `establishments`
- **Data Source**: `establishments.json` file


## Deliverables

- **Deliverable 1**: A Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` containing code that imports the data and sets up and updates the `uk_food` database.

- **Deliverable 2**: A Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` containing code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.


## Conclusion

This project involves importing food hygiene data into a MongoDB database, setting up the database, and performing various queries and analysis on the data. I was able to load, query, and analyze the `establishments.json` data in MongoDB using Python and the `pymongo` library.
